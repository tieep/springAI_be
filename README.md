üñºÔ∏è Spring AI Image Analysis: Building Powerful Multimodal LLM APIs

This project is based on the original repository from BootcampToProd‚Äôs Spring AI Image Analysis Guide(https://github.com/BootcampToProd/spring-ai-image-analysis-cookbook)
, which I have cloned and customized.

‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Before running the application, make sure to provide the following environment variable:

GEMINI_API_KEY ‚Üí Your Google Gemini API key
.

You can set it in your IDE or as a system environment variable.

Provide an image URL for analysis.
You can use this test image: https://postimg.cc/9DT2sPTS/dfd792fa ( select link in Direct link)

3. Analyze Image from Base64

POST /api/v1/image/analysis/from-base64
Send the image encoded in Base64 format.
